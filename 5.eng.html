  Diggin' through your old birthday letters <br><br>
  A crumpled 20 still in the box<br><br>
  I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it<br><br>
  Even if it's the last 20 that I've got, oh<br><br>
  I'm still holdin' on to everything that's dead and gone<br><br>
  I don't wanna say goodbye, 'cause this one means forever<br><br>
  Now you're in the stars and six-feet's never felt so far<br><br>
  Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers<br><br>
  <ul>
